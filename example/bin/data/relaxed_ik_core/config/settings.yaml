  link_radius: 0.05 # by default
  # 1. FIRST ENTRY: please select from noECA, ECA, ECA3, and ECAA
  # noECA: doesn't incorporate environment collision avoidance
  # ECA (by default): incorporates environment collision avoidance
  # ECA3: incorporates environment collision avoidance, but only considers end-effector position goal matching,
  #       and does not try to match the orientation of goals
  # ECAA: incorporates environment collision avoidance, adaptively adjusts the weight on the orientation
  #       matching objectives on-the-fly, such that the importance of orientationmatching is reduced
  #       when the robot is close to a collision state and raised to its standard value
  #       when the robot is not close to a collision.
  # 2. SECOND ENTRY: please select from noSM and SM
  # noSM: doesn't incorporate smooth motion synthesis
  # SM (by default): incorporates smooth motion synthesis
  # # Concatenate the entries with a single '+', for example, ECA+SM
  # 3. THIRD ENTRY: please select from online and offline
  # online: smaller weight (1 and 1) to the matching position and orientation objectives
  # offline: larger weight (10 and 9) to the matching position and orientation objectives
  # # Concatenate the entries with a single '+', for example, ECA+SM+online
