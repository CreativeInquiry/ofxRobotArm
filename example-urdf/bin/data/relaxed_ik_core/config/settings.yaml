  # noECA: doesn't incorporate environment collision avoidance
  # ECA (by default): incorporates environment collision avoidance
  # ECA3: incorporates environment collision avoidance, but only considers end-effector position goal matching,
  #       and does not try to match the orientation of goals
  # ECAA: incorporates environment collision avoidance, adaptively adjusts the weight on the orientation
  #       matching objectives on-the-fly, such that the importance of orientationmatching is reduced
  #       when the robot is close to a collision state and raised to its standard value
  #       when the robot is not close to a collision.
