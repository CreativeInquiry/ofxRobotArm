##About
`ofxRobotArm` is an openFrameworks addon for doing creative things with robot arms. The goal of the addon is to remove as many technical barriers as possible to get up and running with 6-axis robots. We've included a number of examples that show you how different ways of controlling and interacting with a robot arm, including direct manipulation, geometry-based manipulation, motion capture-based interactions, and keyframe animation. By building `ofxRobotArm` in openFrameworks, we hope to help you extend human-robot interaction in new and diverse ways.

Currently the addon is configured to just work with Universal Robot's [UR5](http://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) robot. In future development, we would like to include kinematic models for additional robot brands. Please [contact us]() if you would like us to include your robot model or if you would like specific features implemented.

Development for `ofxRobotArm` is sponsored by [The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/). 
Technical development was lead by [Dan Moore](http://makeitdoathing.com) with examples from [Madeline Gannon](http://madlab.cc).


##Overview
`ofxRobotArm` is structured as two parts: `ofxURDriver` holds the specific control software and kinematic model for a [UR5](http://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur5-robot/) robot; `ofxRobotArm` holds the generic tools and techniques for controlling and interacting with a robot arm. `ofxURDriver` adapts ThomasTimm's (ur_modern_driver)[https://github.com/ThomasTimm/ur_modern_driver] package for ROS to openFrameworks. To customize `ofxRobot` to work with your specific model and brand of robot, use `ofxURDriver` as a template for your robot's kinematic model and control protocol.

##Dependencies
- ofxURDriver
- ofxTiming
- ofxCV
- ofxNatNet
- ofxGML
- ofxGizmo
- ofxTimeline
- ofxPtf

Please see the `installAddons.sh` script to clone all the external addons used in the examples.  Also please note that these addons might depend on other external addons.  Please reference the README for each of the external addons. 

##Examples
We've also included a number of example projects that show you the most common ways of programming 6-axis robots:

**1. Direct Manipulation**
 - [`example-basic-move`](/example-basic-move) lets you use your mouse to drag around and rotate your robot.
 
**2. Timeline & KeyFramed Animation**
 - [`example-timeline`](/example-timeline) lets you use build keyframed animations to record and play robot movements.


**3. Geometry-Driven Movements**
 - [`example-follow-path`](/example-follow-path) lets you import 2D and 3D paths for the robot to follow.
 - [`example-follow-surface`](/example-follow-surface) lets you project paths on a 3D surface for the robot to follow.

**4. Motion Capture Based Interactions**
 - [`example-follow-mocap`](/example-follow-mocap) lets the robot follow a rigid body detected by an OptiTrack Motion Capture System.
 - [`example-follow-mocap-path`](/example-follow-surface) lets you record a path for the robot follow using an OptiTrack Motion Capture System.

##Getting Started
We've included a tutorial for getting started with `ofxRobotArm` as [here](/example-basic-move/README.md). 

1. Start with [`example-basic-move`](/example-basic-move) to learn how set up your robot for open-loop control, and to get the basic structure and workflow for `ofxRobotArm`.
2. Next try [`example-timeline`](/example-timeline).
3. After that, move on to the geometry examples: [`example-follow-path`] (/example-follow-path) and [`example-follow-surface`] (/example-follow-surface).
4. The motion capture examples [`example-follow-mocap`](/example-follow-mocap) and [`example-follow-mocap-path`](/example-follow-mocap-path) are fairly advanced and require very specific hardware configurations to run properly. A more common motion capture sensor, like a Kinect, could be used in place of an OptiTrack system to get similar results.
