##Basic Move Example


######This example shows you the basics of open-loop control for a robot arm using _ofxRobotArm_.

####What You'll Learn
_Basic Move_ goes over:
  * How to connect to your robot via ethernet
  * How to get your robot moving using ```ofxGizmo```
  * Basic UI layout of ofxRobotArm
  

##Getting Started
To get started with `ofxRobotArm` you first need to grab all the dependant libraries for the addon. Use the `installAddons.sh` script to clone all the external addons used in the examples. Also please note that these addons might depend on other external addons, so reference the README of each external addons to make sure you've got everything.

The next step is to set up your robot's ethernet connection. 

Universal Robots has instructions for setting up ethernet communication in their [User Manual](http://www.universal-robots.com/download/). But they also provide a walk-thru [here](http://www.universal-robots.com/how-tos-and-faqs/how-to/ur-how-tos/ethernet-ip-guide-18712/).

Once you have an IP address for your robot, all you should need to do is modify one line of code in `example-basic-move` to connect to your robot:
   - On `line 40` replace the default ip address with your robot's ip address in `robot.setup()`
   
After that, run the project. You should see your robot positioned properly of the left side of the screen.
Also, you should see that the Robot's FPS is running about 120fps in the lower left hand corner of the GUI. If you don't see a robot in the GUI, or if the Robot's FPS says 0, jump down to the Troubleshooting section.

##Navigating the UI
The UI for _ofxRobotArm_ is laid out in a few sections:
  * The left half holds the _Simulated Robot_
      * You can manaully move and reorient _Simulated Robot_ to update your real robot
  * The right half holds the _Realtime Robot_
      * The _Realtime Robot_ reads and visualizes the joint values streaming from your robot's control box
  * The top right visualizes `target` and `actual` joint values
      * This panel is really helpful for debugging when you're hitting joint limits
  * The vertical panel to the far right holds a lot of important information and settings
      1. Showing the robot's current postion & orientation
      2. Showing the robot's current speed & acceleration
      3. A panel with buttons to `get`, `set`, and `move` the robot's position & orientation
      4. A panel for fine tuning movements: Acceleration Multiplier, Speed Divider, Lerp Factor

##Get Moving
Here's the basic workflow for running `example-basic-move`:

1. Plug in your ethernet connection between your computer and your robot, and make sure you're on the same network :)
2. Run `example-basic-move`. You should see the _Realtime Robot_ on the right of your screen in the same configuration as your actual robot IRL.
3. On the far right panel, press `get TCP` to make the _Simulated Robot_ on the left match the _Realtime Robot_ on the right.
4. In the same panel, press `set TCP` to change the position or orientation of the _Simulated Robot_.
   * When you press `set TCP`, a gizmo should pop up at the TCP of the _Simulated Robot_. 
   * You can click and drag the axes and planes of the gizmo to move the _Simulated Robot_.  
5. With the _Simulated Robot_ moving, press `m` to move your actual robot.
   * If the _Realtime Robot_ isn't moving after you press `m`, check your Acceleration Multiplier and Speed Divider: if the Acceleration Multiplier is too low, or the Speed Divider is too high, the robot will move _verrrrrry_ slowly.
6. Press `m` again to stop sending move commands to the robot.


####Other Usage Notes
We rely on hotkeys for triggering a lot of the UI functionality. Below are the hotkeys we use that work across all the example projects included in ofxRobotArm.

KeyPressed commands for controlling the robot:
- m: move

KeyPressed commands for controlling gizmo:
- r: rotate
- g: translate
- s: scale

KeyPressed commands for viewport navigation:
- 1: Top View
- 2: Front View
- 3: Side View
- 4: Perspective View
